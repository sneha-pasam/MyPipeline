Jenkins Pipeline for CI/CD
Overview
This repository contains a Jenkins pipeline script for implementing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications using Jenkins and GitHub integration.

Features
Automated Builds: Automatically trigger builds whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.
Testing Automation: Automatically run unit tests, integration tests, or any other test suites as part of the pipeline.
Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploy the application to staging or production environments after successful builds and tests.
GitHub Integration: Seamlessly integrate Jenkins with GitHub for version control and collaboration.
Usage
To use the Jenkins pipeline in your project:

Set up a Jenkins instance and install the necessary plugins.
Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
Define the pipeline script in the job configuration, either directly in the Jenkins UI or by referencing a script from your Git repository.
Customize the pipeline script to fit your project's specific requirements, such as specifying the Git repository URL, build commands, and test suites.
Trigger a build of the pipeline to start the CI/CD process.
For detailed instructions on setting up and configuring the Jenkins pipeline, refer to the documentation or follow the step-by-step guide provided in the repository.
